# Bradly's CrunchBase Job Search Helper
Google Chrome Extension for keeping track of companies you\'ve applied to and viewing them on CrunchBase.

## Introduction

Want to use CrunchBase to find the latest and greatest company to work for? Me too! That\'s why I created this extension so that we could. This extension currently takes in a spreadsheet and then highlights search results based upon whether you\'ve applied recently or viewed the company recently. More features to come but that\'s the basics.

## Usage

Go to a CrunchBase.com/search and upload an xlsx spreadsheet with two sheets. The first sheet containing a column named Company and another column named Date. In the Company column should be the name of the companies you\'ve applied to and in the Date column should be the date you applied. You can apply multiple times and have multiple rows of the same company. The second sheet should be blank but contain a column for Company and a column for Date like the first. This second sheet is going to be used to keep track of companies you\'ve "visited". (Clicked on in the search results)

## Motivation

The motivation behind this is to improve your job search experience! Hopefully this will be used on other websites like Indeed and LinkedIn but let\'s start with CrunchBase first.
